####################################""""
UP TO here we have implemented the main prayerTime feature of the bot, it schedule well, get data from database (users and cities), also registration. and when time come it send a message to the registred users each in it's city and region prayers time.
Note: reminder time before the prayer time is set to 10 min
=====*********

well to do but not urgent
-----------------------------
add saha shourek ftourek and ramdank  (inject that in schedules and if needed schedule for other times!!!!)

things to do to enchance what was done
####################################################
==>multiple reminders
    ====> we are providing remindersDistants, at discordBot level for testing (same for all users), we will change that to by users (we have to make more enchancement to user registration process (so it include those info, and in  case not provided, we fallback to a default.))

      // [to see] NOte: when you get reminders from users, you can check if it's in or not (the best is to have a 3, or 4 or predefined, bot config, set of values, and users choose just one of them, then in all cities you schedule such a thing, and send to just the one that have that, the other choice, is to save such an info at registration time, and handle that too at remove time, so it's always effective)

==>handle else cases for time scheduling (when current time pass ...) (mostly done)

==> handle connexion problem, auth to google api failure and all, try again multiple time!! (5 times may be!!)

==> handle probable arising exceptions (specially the one using API ...)
####################################




Later in configuration 
============================
reminder time  before prayer time

















No more necessary

our function whith it's counter, that go and loop through the queue, with settimout, and it exec  the callback that handle user showing message
